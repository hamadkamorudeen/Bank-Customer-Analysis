# Bank Customer Analysis â€“ Final Data Analysis Project

## ðŸ“Š Project Overview

This project analyzes a bank's customer dataset to uncover insights on demographics, engagement, financial behavior, and churn (exited customers). The analysis helps the bank make informed decisions on customer retention, segmentation, and service optimization.

Data sources:
- `Customer_Info.csv` â€“ contains demographic and salary info
- `Account_Info.csv` â€“ contains account balances, product use, and churn status

---

## ðŸ§¹ Data Preparation

- **Merged** `Customer_Info` and `Account_Info` using `CustomerId`.
- **Removed** duplicate records and extra `Tenure` column.
- **Cleaned** currency fields (`Balance`, `EstimatedSalary`) and converted to numerical.
- **Grouped** ages into defined ranges (e.g., 25â€“34, 35â€“44).
- **Dropped** `CustomerId` to anonymize the dataset.

### 3. Financial Performance
- **Credit Scores**:
  - Stable across age groups, though older customers have slightly wider distributions.
- **Balances**:
  - Tend to increase with age.
  - **35â€“54 age group** holds the highest balances.
- **Estimated Salary**: Fairly uniform across age groups, showing no strong correlation.

### 4. Exited Customers Analysis
- **Exited customers** are more likely to:
  - Be aged **45â€“54**, or over 55.
  - Have **higher balances**.
  - Have **lower credit scores** on average.
- Younger, lower-balance customers are less likely to churn.

### 5. Customer Segmentation
- Customers split into:
  - **High balance**: Tend to have higher estimated salaries and are slightly older.
  - **Low balance**: More spread across age and salary levels.
- These segments could benefit from **tailored financial products**.

## âœ… Conclusions & Recommendations

- **Retention Strategy**:
  - Focus on **high-balance, older customers**, especially those nearing 10-year tenure.
  - Investigate why high-balance users are exiting; possibly a lack of premium product offerings.

- **Product Offering**:
  - Consider segment-based marketing:
    - **Young adults**: Offer starter packages.
    - **Middle-aged professionals**: Cross-sell investment and premium banking tools.

- **Credit Risk Management**:
  - Monitor lower credit score individuals who also have high balances â€” possible default risk.

- **Geography Optimization**:
  - Customize offers by geographyâ€”especially where credit and salary behavior differ (e.g., Germany vs Spain).
